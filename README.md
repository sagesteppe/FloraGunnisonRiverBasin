# FloraGunnisonRiverBasin
An attempt to generate a floristic inventory of the entire Gunnison River Basin in Western Colorado.

The Gunnison River Basin is emerging as one of the worlds few model ecosystems, and is the only one in the Western United States.
The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Gothic, has long served as a nexus of natural history inspired research in the Temperate Biome.
In addition to the experimental and observation studies in this area, significant botanical activity has been exerted throughout the area.
Previous floristic activity in the area has been intensive, however a recent collation of these efforts is lacking. 
Most historic efforts have focused on the upper portions of the Basin, neglecting the floristically intriguing Colorado Plateau portions, which include significant outcroppings of Mancos Shale.
Data on the current distributional limits, phylogenetic relationships, and number of species are wanting. 

Herein we attempt to resolve the identities of all known species in the Basin, and provide information on suitable vouchers for the species.
